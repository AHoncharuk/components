## Overview

Things to know when using the popover plugin:


- Popovers rely on the 3rd party library [Tether](http://tether.io/) for positioning. You must include [tether.min.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether/blob/master/dist/js/tether.min.js) before bootstrap.js in order for popovers to work!
- Popovers require the [tooltip plugin]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/tooltips/) as a dependency.
- Popovers are opt-in for performance reasons, so **you must initialize them yourself**.
- Zero-length `title` and `content` values will never show a popover.
- Specify `container: 'body'` to avoid rendering problems in more complex components (like our input groups, button groups, etc).
- Triggering popovers on hidden elements will not work.
- Popovers for `.disabled` or `disabled` elements must be triggered on a wrapper element.
- When triggered from hyperlinks that span multiple lines, popovers will be centered. Use `white-space: nowrap;` on your `<a>`s to avoid this behavior.


## Example: Enable popovers everywhere
One way to initialize all popovers on a page would be to select them by their `data-toggle` attribute:

$('[data-toggle="popover"]').popover()

## Example: Using the `container` option
When you have some styles on a parent element that interfere with a popover, you'll want to specify a custom `container` so that the popover's HTML appears within that element instead.

$('.example-popover').popover({
  container: 'body'
})

## Popover template (right position)

<div class="popover popover--right">
  <h3 class="popover__title">Popover right</h3>
  <div class="popover__content">
    <p>Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Dismiss on next click
Use the `focus` trigger to dismiss popovers on the next click that the user makes.

<a tabindex="0" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" role="button" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" title="Dismissible popover" data-content="And here's some amazing content. It's very engaging. Right?">Dismissible popover</a>

$('.popover-dismiss').popover({
  trigger: 'focus'
})

### Options

Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to `data-`, as in `data-animation=""`.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 100px;">Name</th>
      <th style="width: 100px;">Type</th>

      <td>
        <p>Appends the popover to a specific element. Example: <code>container: 'body'</code>. This option is particularly useful in that it allows you to position the popover in the flow of the document near the triggering element -Â which will prevent the popover from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.</p>

#### Data attributes for individual popovers
Options for individual popovers can alternatively be specified through the use of data attributes, as explained above.

### Methods

#### `$().popover(options)`

Initializes popovers for an element collection.

#### `.popover('show')`

Reveals an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been shown** (i.e. before the `shown.bs.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover. Popovers whose both title and content are zero-length are never displayed.

#### `.popover('hide')`

Hides an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been hidden** (i.e. before the `hidden.bs.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover.

#### `.popover('toggle')`

Toggles an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been shown or hidden** (i.e. before the `shown.bs.popover` or `hidden.bs.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover.

#### `.popover('dispose')`

Hides and destroys an element's popover. Popovers that use delegation (which are created using [the `selector` option](#options)) cannot be individually destroyed on descendant trigger elements.

### Events

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive">

      <td>show.bs.popover</td>
      <td>This event fires immediately when the <code>show</code> instance method is called.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shown.bs.popover</td>
      <td>This event is fired when the popover has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hide.bs.popover</td>
      <td>This event is fired immediately when the <code>hide</code> instance method has been called.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hidden.bs.popover</td>
      <td>This event is fired when the popover has finished being hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).</td>
